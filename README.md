This is an audio e-commerce website built using React, with design taken from Figma. It's an on-going project, and the first project I've built using React, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Functionality to come is -

- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- Backend persistence using Node.js/Express/Mongo DB so that users can keep track of what's in the cart after refreshing page.
